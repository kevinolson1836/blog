## My main duties 
As a Building Automation Specialist at Siemens, I play a key role in advancing smart building technology and sustainability. 
I focus on providing expert support in designing, implementing, and maintaining advanced building automation systems. With a 
deep understanding of control systems, I work closely with clients to develop customized solutions that enhance energy efficiency, 
occupant comfort, and overall operational performance.

In my role, I excel at troubleshooting complex issues, ensuring systems operate at peak performance, and providing ongoing technical support.
I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, project managers, and clients to ensure successful automation projects from concept to completion.

My work involves conducting detailed system assessments, crafting innovative automation strategies, and managing the smooth integration 
of various building technologies. I'm proficient in programming and configuring automation systems, and I’m dedicated to delivering reliable
and user-friendly solutions that reflect Siemens' commitment to excellence.

In addition, I configure our front-end and back-end software to ensure seamless integration between our hardware and software along with 3rd
party devices. This required step allows us to bridge the gap between automation technology and software solutions, ensuring that
our systems are not only functional but also easy to use and manage.
