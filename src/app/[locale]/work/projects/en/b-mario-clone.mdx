## ***Starting out***

This project originally started as joke between me and my friends. We were in college... doing college things, 
looking for fun cheap things we can do. So I introduced my friends into the amazing world of programming, specifically
 Python!

## ***where do my friends come into play?***
At this time I was using Python for about a year or two so I had a pretty good handle on the programming side, but I
was lacking skills in sound design and the art work. Lucky thats where my friends come in! my friend and good buddy, Ryan
is an amazing music genus and made this fantastic 
[up-beat 8bit soundtrack](https://github.com/kevinolson1836/mario-remake/blob/master/audio/backgroundmusic.wav).

Our two other friends made the funny crude art and voice lines. If you were to ask me what the original plan
for the voice line and art work was I wouldn't be able to tell you because how random and chaotic it became.
In the end as far as I can tell, it transformed from a Mario clone to a tale of a plumber who falls down a clogged 
toilet and is transported into a 2D platformer, where he must survive for as long as possible. You must try to
doge obstacles that are buggy and glitchy on purpose. Overall one of the most fun times I had in college.

## ***Challenges***

There was a few challenges in this project but nothing that stopped me from creating what classifies just barely as a "game"

###### 1. Coding challenges

This was my first time diving into the world of game development, I had an absolute blast with the freedom that comes
with game development, however all this fun does come with its challenges. This being my first time, I had no idea
how to design the game from the programming side. I ended up making some awful spaghetti code strung together by 
hopes and dreams. Looking back if I were to remake this project I would want to have a clear goal in the layout of my code.

###### 2. Working within a group

Working within a group or a team of people will always have its challenges even in a fun project like this. A few times
we ran into "creative decisions" disputes. This caused a few issues with the project and ultimately a loss of motovation
to keep going.

###### 3. Animation
One of the hardest but most rewarding parts of the project for me was figuring out how to animate. We hand drew all of
the animation frames within the game. After we figured out how to even draw the art it than came onto my plate to figure
out how to make it look good and look natural. directionality was a very fun challenge to fiure out. 

## ***lessons learned***

1. I learned that proper origination of code is very important
2. Group work will almost always have people butting heads
3. animation is hard but was very fun to learn.
