## What we made

This was one of my projects during college that I found particularly enjoyable. I worked in a group on this project, 
which involved approaching local businesses and offering to build them a website. We were able to get a local bar/brewery 
that had recently opened as a client. We built a few basic pages and a menu with food/drinks.

We held meetings with them to understand their website requirements and what they wanted from a website. Unfortunately, 
halfway through the semester, they stopped responding to us and went out of business, we were unable to meet with them any 
further. As a result, our professor then took over and acted as the client for the remainder of the semester.

## Its not over just yet

Despite this setback, my group and I were determined to make the best of the situation. We divided the workload by 
assigning tasks based on our individual strengths. One member had strong written skills but limited web development 
experience, so we had him lead on project reports and diagramming while the rest of the group focused on building the website.

I took the lead on development and distributed tasks to the rest of the group. However, despite regular check-ins and 
assurances that tasks were on track to be completed on time, my group members struggled to meet their deadlines. This 
resulted in me having to take on a larger portion of the workload, including building the main page, menu page, connecting
 to the database, and creating a secure login page for the administrator.

## My overall experience

This experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of keeping a team on task and on schedule. Most 
importantly, you need teammates you can rely on. It was challenging to have to take on so much of the workload on
 my own, but it also allowed me to gain valuable skills in PHP, database management, website security, and deploying 
 the code to a live server. 

Even though it was stressful and painful, doing all of the programming I was able to learn an incredible amount of 
info on PHP and website development for a real client with real requirements that we must meet within the deadline. 
This experience taught me communication skills, time management, website development, and managing a team.
