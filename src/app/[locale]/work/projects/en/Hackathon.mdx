## What is a hackathon ?

I was browsing around on the internet one day and stumbled upon something called a “Hackathon” and thought it would 
be a fun time to go and try it out! If you are unfamiliar with what a Hackathon is, its basically a big event where 
either a group or an individual has a weekend to build a new app or program thats inline with the topic. Typically 
from what i've seen this is mainly used as a networking opportunity and a fun event.

My friends and I attended a hackathon, which proved to be a wonderful experience! We went in with very little idea 
of what to expect, as none of us had ever participated in a hackathon before we didnt even have any specific project
 in mind. My two friends, Brad and Joe, were both relatively new to programming. Brad was proficient in HTML/CSS, 
 while Joe was learning Python. At the time I was the most experienced programmer in the group, Ive been building 
 websites and developing python scripts for a few years. I took on the role of leading the project and assigning 
 tasks based on our individual skills.

Despite a rough start, from us not having a clue of what's going on and some initial brainstorming, we came up with 
a word search and we began programming about an hour or two into the event.

Joe and I worked together on integrating the Python back-end, we used Flask as our bank end. While we were doing the 
back-end, Brad started on the front-end. We made some good progress on the project but we needed to take brain break 
and lucky the event offered some food and other mini events that gave us the little break we needed.

 were able to successfully complete the project within our limited time frame. However, unfortunately, we were unable 
 to have it judged as one of our group members had a work obligation and needed to leave early, and all members were 
 required to be present for judging. Despite this, we were all proud of what we had accomplished.

Brad, who was skilled in HTML, took on the task of building the front-end. Joe and I focused on the back-end, with 
Joe working on the algorithm for generating and placing the words in our word search project, and I worked on getting
 the back-end logic working utilzing Flask and filling in the remaining spaces with random characters. We chose to use
  Flask for the back-end, as I had previous experience with it, and Joe would be able to do his part in Python.

The hackathon also included events to teach us more about GitHub, test-driven development, and what a "average day" 
would look like. I found these to be very informative and helpful, and it gave me a glimpse into the development cycle
 used by industry professionals. Additionally, I was able to network with other developers, getting very helpful insite for a Jr dev.
