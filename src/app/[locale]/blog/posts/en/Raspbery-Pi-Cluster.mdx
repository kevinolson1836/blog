# Why a Cluster?
To be honest, I do not require the solution that a Cluster offers, that being HA also known as high availability. My Lab is currently being used by
just me. So when a service does go down for what ever reason it only effects me, however because this is a Lab, a place for me to tinker with and learn
I wanted to set one up for fun!

# The hardware
In the perfect world i would have 3 or more machines with the exact same hardware, but because that is expense I used the next best option i had 
and that was the 3 Raspberry Pi's I had laying around. luckily you do not need the hardware to be exactly the same across machines so i was able 
to use my 2GB, 4GB and 8GB Pi's I had on hand. what I was missing was some sort of storage solution. The micro SD card works for a while, but 
as we all know they tend to fail and fail often when an OS is on them, so after a bit of research, I found a [1TB SATA SSD](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZYQ84CM) 
and a [SATA to USB cable](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083ZJZGH2) that I can use. I set up two partitions on it, 250GB for the OS and related 
software and the other 750GB as a partition for [Gluster](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs) Now you might be wondering how I plan on powering 
the Pi's, Thats where this [5 port POE TP-Link switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HZFY3F) comes into play


# 3D Prints
Now that I got the hardware picked out, Next I needed to find a place to keep it, and what better place than my Rack! it has everything we need, it 
has power outlets for the POE switch and the rest of my networking gear to integrate it into my Homelab network. After looking around on a few of the 
3D printing websites for some inspiration I created this:    ![IMG2](/images/projects/raspPiCluster/2.png) ![IMG3](/images/projects/raspPiCluster/3.png)  
![IMG4](/images/projects/raspPiCluster/4.png)  ![IMG5](/images/projects/raspPiCluster/5.png)  This fits 4 Raspberry Pi's and the switch all within a 1U rack space!
It may not be perfect, but it doesn't need to be, Homelabs are janky by design right!? for my needs it works perfect and fits in my rack 
with out taking up too much space.

# The set up 
After putting the 3d prints together and hooking up the needed cables into the rest of my Lab I got started on the software side. As stated before, I decided to
go with glusterfs aka Gluster. If you are unfamiliar with [Gluster](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs), it is a free and open source software scalable network filesystem. With it I can achieve 
HA with my network storage that I will use for my global configuration files and some base OS's that I need to be available at all times. Along side of Gluster
I am using Docker Swarm to provide HA for my docker containers. I went with Docker Swarm over kubernetes for the easy setup and low resource requirements
plus I already have several containers running on my main server that I can easily transfer over. Speaking of my main server, now that I have the Cluster 
up and running, I can write a small script that turns off the server when its not being used and when I need the extra power that the Pi's can 
not provide I can quickly spin up the main server, saving on electricity.
