# Setting Up Mealie in My Homelab with Docker Compose

Recently, I added a new tool to my homelab that has been a game-changer for managing recipes: **Mealie**. It's a self-hosted recipe manager that makes organizing, importing, and sharing recipes incredibly easy. Let me walk you through why I chose Mealie, how I set it up using Docker Compose, and some of the cool features it offers.

## What is Mealie?

Mealie is a lightweight and flexible recipe manager that can run in a Docker container. Its standout feature is the ability to scrape recipes directly from websites, making it easy to build a personalized collection of your favorite dishes. You can also import recipes from existing files and organize them into categories for better accessibility.

Best of all, I can access my Mealie instance securely at [https://mealie.kevin-olson.net/](https://mealie.kevin-olson.net/), thanks to some custom DNS configuration.


## Setting Up Mealie with Docker Compose

Here’s how I set up Mealie in my homelab:

### ‎ 

### 1. Create a Docker Compose File
First I needed to create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content for my use case:


```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

```yaml
  services:
    mealie:
      image: ghcr.io/mealie-recipes/mealie:v2.1.0 #
      container_name: mealie
      restart: always
      ports:
          - "9925:9000" # change this as needed
      deploy:
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 1000M #
      volumes:
        - mealie-data:/app/data/
      environment:
        # Set Backend ENV Variables Here
        ALLOW_SIGNUP: "true"
        PUID: 1000
        PGID: 1000
        TZ: America/Anchorage
        MAX_WORKERS: 1
        WEB_CONCURRENCY: 1
        BASE_URL: https://mealie.kevin-olson.net

  volumes:
    mealie-data:

```

### ‎ 

### 2. Run the Container
After saving the configuration, I ran the following command to spin up the Mealie container:

'''  docker-compose up -d  '''

### ‎ 

### 3. Access Mealie
Once the container was running, I went to make it accessible at localhost:9925 you will need to change the IP and port to your needs. 
if succesful you should land on the main page of Mealie, after you set it up and configure it and you have added some recipies you should see something like this:

### Cool Features of Mealie
Here are some of the awesome things I’ve discovered about Mealie so far:

1. Recipe Scraping
One of Mealie’s most impressive features is its ability to scrape recipes directly from websites. Just paste a URL, and Mealie will automatically extract the ingredients, instructions, and even photos!

2. Importing Recipes
If you have recipes stored in other formats (like JSON or plain text), you can easily import them into Mealie. It supports a variety of formats, making migration seamless.

3. Custom Categories
Organizing recipes is a breeze with Mealie’s category system. I’ve created categories like "Weeknight Dinners," "Desserts," and "Meal Prep" to quickly find what I need.

4. Meal Planning
Mealie isn’t just a recipe organizer—it also offers a meal planning feature. I can schedule meals for the week and even generate a shopping list based on the recipes I’ve selected.

5. Multi-User Support
Mealie supports multiple users, so everyone in the household can contribute their favorite recipes or access the shared collection.

6. Self-Hosting Benefits
Running Mealie in my homelab means I retain full control of my data. It’s fast, private, and tailored to my needs.



### Why I Love Mealie
Mealie has turned my scattered recipe collection into a well-organized library that's accessible from anywhere. Its integration with Docker makes deployment straightforward, and its rich features—like recipe scraping and meal planning—make it a powerful tool for anyone who loves to cook.

If you’re looking for a self-hosted solution to manage your recipes, I highly recommend giving Mealie a try. And if you want to see what it looks like in action, check out https://mealie.kevin-olson.net/.
