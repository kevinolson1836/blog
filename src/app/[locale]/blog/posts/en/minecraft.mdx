## Why I wanted to host the server

For many years now I have loved Minecraft and the community around it. I can remember spending countless hours playing on a 
random server with not a lot of active players creating long lasting friendships and memories with the few people that would 
play on the server. Having my Homelab sitting mostly idle, I saw a fabulous opportunity to make a server for me and my friends. 

## What I did different this time

In the past I was using just Minecraft server jar, but that was a nightmare to manage the different Minecraft versions along with
the different Java versions. I was initially considering doing this again but I knew that there must have been a better solution.
I found a docker container and it seemed to work for the most part after a bit of configuration that is. I 
used this for a month or two until I ran into the same issue as before, with managing all of the many different versions of Minecraft and Java. 

Then this most recent time setting up another server I discovered [this docker container](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
This one is much more suited for my use case, it allows you to specify what version of Minecraft, if you want to use a different server like forge
or paper for example and any plugins that you might want to add plus so many other options that I personally did not dive too deep into. 

This all can be configured from the docker-compose.yaml file and this config can be easily moved to a different machine if needed,
the container is an absolute must if you want to deploy your own Minecraft server in ur own Homelab. 

## Okay, but how can others connect? 

You might be wondering how I was able to allow my friends to connect to the server if it’s running in my Homelab in my local network,
 well lucky we have an amazing piece of software called Tailscale, the best free VPN for a Homelab.  currently Tailscale offers what
 they call “funnel” this allows you too open a port to the open internet that anyone can access. When you run the command you specify 
 the port you want to funnel and it gives you a web address that you can then give out to your friends to connect to the server without 
 installing the application. So keep in mind that this feature is still in beta and functionality can change. 

Using the new docker container  and Tailscale has allowed me to create and easily manage a Minecraft server for me and my friends. 
Opening this port up to the world does come with security issues that you must address if you want to be safe.
